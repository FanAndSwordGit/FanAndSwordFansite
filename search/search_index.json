That's typically followed by the tagline, \"Kyoshi's #1 Fan\"</p> <p>Obviously, I'm a huge Avatar fan. I do have other interests though! Namely Lego, indie game development, and all things creativity.</p> <p>I work full-time, so this site is simply a passionate side-project of mine, among many other creative pursuits.</p> <p>It's truly an honor to meet you!</p> What is your Avatar journey? <p>Good question!</p> <p>I fall under the COVID-19 pandemic group of fans, when Avatar captured the hearts of many during lockdown. </p> <p>I hadn't heard of the show before then. And I didn't know it was gaining a new generation of fans at the time - the cover art for the show's listing in Netflix just drew me in.</p> <p>The story was epic, the world was immersive, and it was just so perfect! I instantly jumped into Korra then, along with buying all the comics, novels, etc... as a one-man fan!</p> <p>My first real introduction to the community though was through the Avatar Generations mobile game. It was fun to have a dedicated Discord space with fans, playing an Avatar game that introduced new bits of lore. When that shut down, I also helped rally efforts around archiving the game as much as possible. I've always enjoyed documentation, writing, etc... so this was a fun way for me to engage with the community more personally.</p> <p>And now my ambitions have aimed higher  - I wanted to build a dedicated fansite where I could celebrate all things Avatar! There is a bright future ahead for the franchise under Avatar Studios, so this is the perfect time to create this new space.</p> Who is your favorite Avatar character? <p>Everyone's favorite Kyoshi Warrior! - Suki </p> What is your favorite element &amp; nation? <p>I'd have to go with fire - flameo, hotman!  </p> <p>It's an element of deep energy and passion, symbolizing warmth and the inner fuel of creativity.</p> <p>Also, the architecture of the Fire Nation is quite beautiful!</p>"},{"location":"about/#about-this-fansite","title":"About This Fansite","text":"Aren't there Avatar fansites already out there? <p>You would be correct - it\u2019s neat seeing how everyone approaches Avatar content!</p> <p>I'm just building a personal space to share my own thoughts, and perhaps some find it interesting too </p> What is the vision for this site? <p>Like the Avatar, ideally a mastery of everything!</p> <p>In short, I'm planning:</p> <ul> <li>Blog space (for discussion, reviews, etc...)</li> <li>Project space (personal projects such as fan novel, Lego builds, etc...)</li> <li>As well as...<ul> <li>Highlighting cool things from the Avatar community</li> <li>Offering guides, recommendations, and more for Avatar games</li> <li>Supporting a Discord server for this site</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Where can I stream, read, etc...

Heralding the next avatar was a highly regarded tradition and it was a blessing for the cycle to return to the Fire Nation. </p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Okino glanced out upon the sprawling fields of grain passed down through generations of his family. Living on the outskirts of the Fire Nation, this land provided the perfect grounds for the caretaking of dragons. Soaring above the crops, they had plentiful amounts of food and cushioned nesting spaces. They were beautiful creatures, capable of emotional bonds arguably beyond the limits of humans. He wondered just how much the dragons looked forward to the coming occasion too.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To avoid any unforeseen circumstances, a large clearing had been made in the center of the field. It was a rather crude circle, charred from the breath of Okino\u2019s dragon, Asha. Nonetheless, it was a suitable amount of space for both the eldest of dragons and the fire sages. They would need it in order for the sages to perform intricate spiritual acts, the likes of which no one had seen for centuries. </p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or so Okino had heard.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Truthfully, this just gave him a break from his studies. His father, Teju, was the one working long days and nights for months leading up to the event, but Okino did appreciate the festivities. Their property usually reeked of dragon stenches, and the various incense imported from the Earth Kingdom burned a more regal smell into the air. The pathway of lit torches leading down through the fields and into the small clearing only furthered the pomp and circumstance of it all.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This will make for a good story at the Academy tomorrow, Okino reflected. </p> <p></p> <p>The sun was beginning to set in the distance - a somber reminder of the passing of Avatar Nuju in the wake of finding his reincarnation. The moment was quickly cut off as the fire sages appeared at the edge of their province, walking in sync with purpose and dignity. Just as Okino had been trained to care for dragons since birth, these sages had prepared for decades.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWelcome to the Dragonic Fields. We are honored by your presence,\u201d greeted Teju, upon the sages reaching the inner circle. </p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThank you for the kind words\u201d the eldest fire mage responded, \u201cThe next chapter of history will be laid out before our very eyes.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pleased with this exchange, Teju pulled out a chiseled reed pipe and blew into it wholeheartedly, as if he were an air nomad at heart. It was undoubtedly a small but effective instrument as the largest of the dragons soared down from above. The ground quaked on impact, dust flying into the surrounding rows of crops. Okino had to quickly rustle his clothing ensemble, consisting of baggy khao garments with a golden-threaded krama draped over his shoulders. The only other time he wore this outfit was the day his family gifted a dragon to the Firelord.</p> <p> Mother will not be pleased if this outfit gets\u2026, thought Okino, his fears suddenly interrupted.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the command of the sages, the dragons hurled large billows of colorful flames overhead. </p> <p>The resulting blaze grew in intensity, sparks flying in every direction.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fire sages immediately threw up one hand each towards the spectacle, as though they were testing the warmth of the fire. It was hard to tell if the combined flames spewed more intense than the gazes the fire sages held on their faces.</p> <p> Is the flame changing? thought Okino.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As if on cue, the flames morphed into various silhouettes. Like a dream forming, except everyone was well awake.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Okino peered deeper into the flames, trying to make sense of the imagery. Before he could piece it together, the flames fizzled out. The roar of both the fire and the dragons dissolved into the quiet of the night.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDid it work?\u201d Okino blurted out loud. Teju shot him a look of disapproval - perhaps he had asked the wrong question, as though he doubted the abilities of the sages.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sages appeared unfazed by the remark however. They slowly turned around, a mixture of confusion and dread washed over their faces instead of the intense gaze they held prior.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cApologies fire sages, my son got caught up in the excite\u2026\u201d Teju began.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat is the least of our concerns actually, and your son is right to ask,\u201d the foremost fire sage responded, \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It went quiet again as the realization settled in. It soon gave way to curiosity as questions began to arise. One thought spewed after another, with very little accomplished in the way of resolution.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWere there not enough dragons?\u201d one sage murmured.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s best to return when the sun is highest\u2026\u201d suggested another sage.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAre there any texts on this particular matter?\u201d the eldest sage questioned.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each faint response was like the spear of a water tribesman plunging further into deeper waters, desperate to catch the next meal. Okino could see the dread in his father\u2019s eyes, as any record of this event would surely dishonor their family\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat exactly did you see?\u201d Okino prodded. Speaking out was the least of all concerns now.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe scrolls spoke of clarity in the flames,\u201d the foremost sage responded, \u201cWe were supposed to see visions of a place beyond here - the birthplace of Nuju\u2019s reincarnation.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMaybe a spirit stands in the way? I\u2019ve heard stories of how mischievous they can be with human affairs.\u201d said Okino.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but we scouted this very area for spiritual connections,\u201d another sage replied, \u201cIf a spirit wanted to interfere, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten this far.\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a lackluster response, but no one dared question it. Okino and Teju began directing the dragons back into the sky while the sages deliberated in quick succession. Okino was thankful for Asha\u2019s help as he guided his dragon brethren into the clouds. The largest dragon, Murtagh, remained grounded however, seemingly taking the time to rest.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo on!\u201d Okino urged, \u201cSoar like you are the second sun!\u201d</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clearly the dragon did not hear him as he grunted loudly into the night, craning his neck towards the sages. If the attention was not already on Okino, it surely was now. Asha repeated the gesture, Okino now caught between both of the dragons\u2019 sudden outbursts.</p> <p> What are these dragons doing? Okino wondered. In the midst of the chaos, it suddenly clicked. The reason why the flames could only show where they were. And why the dragons were ever so amused by the secrets just revealed.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That was the moment Teju and the fire sages turned towards Okino.</p> <p> Towards the next Avatar.</p>"},{"location":"projects/fan-novel/chapter-1/#last-reviewed","title":"Last Reviewed","text":"<p>  [ | 10/28/2024]  </p>"},{"location":"projects/fan-novel/preface/","title":"Preface","text":"<p>Part of the mystique and wonder of the Avatar world is the different eras.
