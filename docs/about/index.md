# :question: About

Quite the interesting site, right?

Below are some tabs to better understand this space :smile:
<br><br>

=== "FAQ"

    ### :wave: About Me

    ??? abstract "Who are you?"
        
        On the interwebs I commonly go by IronBaron (shoutout to the Lego fans out there!). That's typically followed by the tagline, "Kyoshi's #1 Fan"

        Obviously, I'm a huge Avatar fan. I do have other interests though! Namely Lego, indie game development, and all things creativity.

        I work full-time, so this site is simply a passionate side-project of mine, among many other creative pursuits.

        It's truly an honor to meet you!

    ??? abstract "What is your Avatar journey?"

        Good question!

        I fall under the COVID-19 pandemic group of fans, when Avatar captured the hearts of many during lockdown. 
        
        I hadn't heard of the show before then. And I didn't know it was gaining a new generation of fans at the time - the cover art for the show's listing in Netflix just drew me in.
        
        The story was epic, the world was immersive, and it was just so perfect! I instantly jumped into Korra then, along with buying all the comics, novels, etc... as a one-man fan!

        My first real introduction to the community though was through the Avatar Generations mobile game. It was fun to have a dedicated Discord space with fans, playing an Avatar game that introduced new bits of lore. When that shut down, I also helped rally efforts around archiving the game as much as possible. I've always enjoyed documentation, writing, etc... so this was a fun way for me to engage with the community more personally.
        
        And now my ambitions have aimed higher :smile: - I wanted to build a dedicated fansite where I could celebrate all things Avatar! There is a bright future ahead for the franchise under Avatar Studios, so this is the perfect time to create this new space.

    ??? abstract "Who is your favorite Avatar character?"

        Everyone's favorite Kyoshi Warrior! - Suki :heart:

    ??? abstract "What is your favorite element & nation?"

        I'd have to go with fire - flameo, hotman! :fire: 
        
        It's an element of deep energy and passion, symbolizing warmth and the inner fuel of creativity.

        Also, the architecture of the Fire Nation is quite beautiful!

    ### :tea: About This Fansite

    ??? abstract "Aren't there Avatar fansites already out there?"

        You would be correct - itâ€™s neat seeing how everyone approaches Avatar content!
        
        I'm just building a personal space to share my own thoughts, and perhaps some find it interesting too :smile:

    ??? abstract "What is the vision for this site?"

        Like the Avatar, ideally a mastery of everything!

        In short, I'm planning:
        
        - Blog space (for news, rumors, thoughts, reviews, etc...)
        - Project space (personal projects such as fan novel, Lego builds, etc...)
        - Wiki space (my own, little spin on organizing Avatar knowledge)
        - As well as...
            - Highlighting cool things from the Avatar community
            - Offering guides, recommendations, and more for Avatar games
            - Supporting a Discord server for this site

    ??? abstract "Can I contribute and/or is there a community?"

        In a way, yes! You can join the Fan & Sword Discord server.
        
        There, you'll be able to connect with other enthusiasts and provide feedback for the site.
        
        The site will not be directly edit-able though as I still would like to keep it a passion project, but I am very open to suggestions as we build an awesome community!
    
    ??? abstract "Where can I stream, read, etc... (insert media) on this site?"

        This site strictly prohibits any form of piracy. I do not support the illegal distribution or downloading of copyrighted material. Users are encouraged to purchase official Avatar: The Last Airbender products through the proper channels.

    ??? abstract "Is there any monetization scheme here?"

        Nope!

        - Any links to official or licensed products are not intended to be affiliate links.
        - I am not sponsored (officially or unofficially) for this work.
        - Access to the site is completely free and openly accessible to all.

        The only cost behind this site is a few bucks for the domain, straight from my own pocket!

        This site is simply a labor of love & passion - I do not seek to earn money with this, and respectfully decline any monetary contributions.
    
    ??? abstract "Do you have any site policies, such as copyright notices, fair use statements, etc...?"

        Yes! You can find it under the Disclaimer tab on this page.
        
        Please refer here: (add link to disclaimer tab)

    ??? abstract "What is considered canon?"

        The subject of "canon or not" walks a fine line, and as an unofficial Avatar site, none of the content here is meant to be a definitive judge on it.

        The general line of reasoning is this:

        - The TV series' are the best metrics of canon
        - Novels, comics, and other official, textual publications that do not conflict with series events are also considered canon, unless otherwise stated.
        - Media with heavy contradictions to the above 2 items range from less-canon to non-canon.
        - Interviews with Bryke, official statements, and similar communications that address canonicity of specific content may override any of the above.

        Please keep in mind, the above is an attempt to capture the thought process. Canon discussions are bound to happen and so I purposely want to keep this answer open-ended.

        From a wiki perspective, content will be divided by media type. For example, if covering a location seen across series, novels, games, and more... each of those instances will be a subpage grouped under the location name. With this, there is not a direct label of "canon" but simply a list of different representations.

=== "Discord"

    Come join the F&S Discord server - it's an awesome community :smile:

    [Fan & Sword Discord](https://discord.gg/tgCDP8vj){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
