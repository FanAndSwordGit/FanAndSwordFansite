# :question: About

Quite the interesting site, right?

Below are some tabs to better understand this space :smile:
<br><br>

=== "FAQ"

    ### :wave: About Me

    ??? abstract "Who are you?"
        
        On the interwebs I commonly go by IronBaron (shoutout to the Lego fans out there!). That's typically followed by the tagline, "Kyoshi's #1 Fan"

        Obviously, I'm a huge Avatar fan. I do have other interests though! Namely Lego, indie game development, and all things creativity.

        I work full-time, so this site is simply a passionate side-project of mine, among many other creative pursuits.

        It's truly an honor to meet you!

    ??? abstract "What is your Avatar journey?"

        Good question!

        I fall under the COVID-19 pandemic group of fans, when Avatar captured the hearts of many during lockdown. 
        
        I hadn't heard of the show before then. And I didn't know it was gaining a new generation of fans at the time - the cover art for the show's listing in Netflix just drew me in.
        
        The story was epic, the world was immersive, and it was just so perfect! I instantly jumped into Korra then, along with buying all the comics, novels, etc... as a one-man fan!

        My first real introduction to the community though was through the Avatar Generations mobile game. It was fun to have a dedicated Discord space with fans, playing an Avatar game that introduced new bits of lore. When that shut down, I also helped rally efforts around archiving the game as much as possible. I've always enjoyed documentation, writing, etc... so this was a fun way for me to engage with the community more personally.
        
        And now my ambitions have aimed higher :smile: - I wanted to build a dedicated fansite where I could celebrate all things Avatar! There is a bright future ahead for the franchise under Avatar Studios, so this is the perfect time to create this new space.

    ??? abstract "Who is your favorite Avatar character?"

        Everyone's favorite Kyoshi Warrior! - Suki :heart:

    ??? abstract "What is your favorite element & nation?"

        I'd have to go with fire - flameo, hotman! :fire: 
        
        It's an element of deep energy and passion, symbolizing warmth and the inner fuel of creativity.

        Also, the architecture of the Fire Nation is quite beautiful!

    ### :tea: About This Fansite

    ??? abstract "Aren't there Avatar fansites already out there?"

        You would be correct - itâ€™s neat seeing how everyone approaches Avatar content!
        
        I'm just building a personal space to share my own thoughts, and perhaps some find it interesting too :smile:

    ??? abstract "What is the vision for this site?"

        Like the Avatar, ideally a mastery of everything!

        In short, I'm planning:
        
        - Blog space (for discussion, reviews, etc...)
        - Project space (personal projects such as fan novel, Lego builds, etc...)
        - As well as...
            - Highlighting cool things from the Avatar community
            - Offering guides, recommendations, and more for Avatar games
            - Supporting a Discord server for this site
    
    ??? abstract "Where can I stream, read, etc... (insert media) on this site?"

        This site strictly prohibits any form of piracy. I do not support the illegal distribution or downloading of copyrighted material. Users are encouraged to purchase official Avatar: The Last Airbender products through the proper channels.

    ??? abstract "Is there any monetization scheme here?"

        Nope!
