# :bookmark_tabs: Chapter 1: New Beginnings

__This__ was a day of honor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What many described as a once in a lifetime experience, for the person being celebrated, they would claim it was the moment of many lifetimes. Heralding the next avatar was a highly regarded tradition and it was a blessing for the cycle to return to the Fire Nation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okino glanced out upon the sprawling fields of grain passed down through generations of his family. Living on the outskirts of the Fire Nation, this land provided the perfect grounds for the caretaking of dragons. Soaring above the crops, they had plentiful amounts of food and cushioned nesting spaces. They were beautiful creatures, capable of emotional bonds arguably beyond the limits of humans. He wondered just how much the dragons looked forward to the coming occasion too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any unforeseen circumstances, a large clearing had been made in the center of the field. It was a rather crude circle, charred from the breath of Okino’s dragon, Asha. Nonetheless, it was a suitable amount of space for both the eldest of dragons and the fire sages. They would need it in order for the sages to perform intricate spiritual acts, the likes of which no one had seen for centuries. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or so Okino had heard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truthfully, this just gave him a break from his studies. His father, Teju, was the one working long days and nights for months leading up to the event, but Okino did appreciate the festivities. Their property usually reeked of dragon stenches, and the various incense imported from the Earth Kingdom burned a more regal smell into the air. The pathway of lit torches leading down through the fields and into the small clearing only furthered the pomp and circumstance of it all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make for a good story at the Academy tomorrow, Okino reflected.

The sun was beginning to set in the distance - a somber reminder of the passing of Avatar Nuju in the wake of finding his reincarnation. The moment was quickly cut off as the fire sages appeared at the edge of their province, walking in sync with purpose and dignity. Just as Okino had been trained to care for dragons since birth, these sages had prepared for decades.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Welcome to the Dragonic Fields. We are honored by your presence,” greeted Teju, upon the sages reaching the inner circle. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you for the kind words” the eldest fire mage responded, “The next chapter of history will be laid out before our very eyes.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleased with this exchange, Teju pulled out a chiseled reed pipe and blew into it wholeheartedly, as if he were an air nomad at heart. It was undoubtedly a small but effective instrument as the largest of the dragons soared down from above. The ground quaked on impact, dust flying into the surrounding rows of crops. Okino had to quickly rustle his clothing ensemble, consisting of baggy khao garments with a golden-threaded krama draped over his shoulders. The only other time he wore this outfit was the day his family gifted a dragon to the Firelord.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mother will not be pleased if this outfit gets…</i>, thought Okino, his fears suddenly interrupted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the command of the sages, the dragons hurled large billows of colorful flames overhead. 

The resulting blaze grew in intensity, sparks flying in every direction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire sages immediately threw up one hand each towards the spectacle, as though they were testing the warmth of the fire. It was hard to tell if the combined flames spewed more intense than the gazes the fire sages held on their faces.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Is the flame changing?</i> thought Okino.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if on cue, the flames morphed into various silhouettes. Like a dream forming, except everyone was well awake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okino peered deeper into the flames, trying to make sense of the imagery. Before he could piece it together, the flames fizzled out. The roar of both the fire and the dragons dissolved into the quiet of the night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did it work?” Okino blurted out loud. Teju shot him a look of disapproval - perhaps he had asked the wrong question, as though he doubted the abilities of the sages.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sages appeared unfazed by the remark however. They slowly turned around, a mixture of confusion and dread washed over their faces instead of the intense gaze they held prior.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Apologies fire sages, my son got caught up in the excite…” Teju began.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That is the least of our concerns actually, and your son is right to ask,” the foremost fire sage responded, “It didn’t work.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went quiet again as the realization settled in. It soon gave way to curiosity as questions began to arise. One thought spewed after another, with very little accomplished in the way of resolution.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Were there not enough dragons?” one sage murmured.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Perhaps it’s best to return when the sun is highest…” suggested another sage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are there any texts on this particular matter?” the eldest sage questioned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each faint response was like the spear of a water tribesman plunging further into deeper waters, desperate to catch the next meal. Okino could see the dread in his father’s eyes, as any record of this event would surely dishonor their family’s name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What exactly did you see?” Okino prodded. Speaking out was the least of all concerns now.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The scrolls spoke of clarity in the flames,” the foremost sage responded, “We were supposed to see visions of a place beyond here - the birthplace of Nuju’s reincarnation.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe a spirit stands in the way? I’ve heard stories of how mischievous they can be with human affairs.” said Okino.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s possible, but we scouted this very area for spiritual connections,” another sage replied, “If a spirit wanted to interfere, we wouldn’t have gotten this far.”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a lackluster response, but no one dared question it. Okino and Teju began directing the dragons back into the sky while the sages deliberated in quick succession. Okino was thankful for Asha’s help as he guided his dragon brethren into the clouds. The largest dragon, Murtagh, remained grounded however, seemingly taking the time to rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go on!” Okino urged, “Soar like you are the second sun!”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the dragon did not hear him as he grunted loudly into the night, craning his neck towards the sages. If the attention was not already on Okino, it surely was now. Asha repeated the gesture, Okino now caught between both of the dragons’ sudden outbursts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What are these dragons doing?</i> Okino wondered. In the midst of the chaos, it suddenly clicked. The reason why the flames could only show where they were. And why the dragons were ever so amused by the secrets just revealed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the moment Teju and the fire sages turned towards Okino.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Towards the next Avatar.</i>
